Question
You are required to build a restaurant chatbot that will assist customers in placing orders for their preferred meals. The main idea is that we want customers to send options and the backend would have a chat app that would respond to the options.

Requirements
ChatBot interface would be like a chat interface
No need for authentication but we should be able to store user session based on devices
When a customer lands on the chatbot page, the bot should send these options to the customer:
Select 1 to Place an order
Select 99 to checkout order
Select 98 to see order history
Select 97 to see current order
Select 0 to cancel order
When a customer selects “1”, the bot should return a list of items from the restaurant. It is up to you to create the items in your restaurant for the customer. The order items can have multiple options but the customer should be able to select the preferred items from the list using this same number select system and place an order.
When a customer selects “99” out an order, the bot should respond with “order placed” and if none the bot should respond with “No order to place”. Customer should also see an option to place a new order
When a customer selects “98”, the bot should be able to return all placed order
When a customer selects “97”, the bot should be able to return current order
When a customer selects “0”, the bot should cancel the order if there is.
